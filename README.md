# sAInage: Sign Language to Text Interpreter

sAInage is a desktop application that uses artificial intelligence to recognize and interpret sign language gestures in real-time²[2]³[3]. The application converts the recognized signs into text format, enabling seamless communication between sign language users and non-sign language users⁴[4].

## Features

- Real-time video input capture from the camera for sign language recognition⁵[5]⁶[6]
- Support for multiple sign languages, allowing users to select their preferred sign language for interpretation⁸[8]⁹[9]
- Text generation for interpreted signs, with an option to adjust recognition sensitivity¹¹[11][^10^][10]
- User authentication and settings management, allowing users to save interpreted text messages for future reference¹²[12]
- Text-to-speech output for non-sign language users
- Continuous improvement of recognition accuracy through machine learning techniques¹³[13]
- Periodic model updates for enhanced accuracy and performance¹⁴[14]

## Installation

To install sAInage, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher and pip installed on your system. You also need to have a standard camera or webcam for video input¹⁵[15]⁷[7].

To install the required dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:
